Step 1 - Preheat oven, grate various cheeses
To prepare this delicious pizza, preheat the oven to 250 degrees Celsius. Now, in a large bowl, grate mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, and cheddar cheese and add corn kernels. Mix them all together.

Step 2 - Work on the pizza base
Now, take the pizza base and spread a thin layer of tomato ketchup on it. Then, spread a thick layer of pizza sauce on it. Finally, top it with the cheese-corn mixture generously.

Step 3 - Bake the pizza
Now, grease a baking tray and put the prepared pizza on it. Place it in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese on top starts turning golden. When done, glaze it with olive oil pomace.

Step 4 - Put seasonings, and it's ready
Then, transfer the golden corn pizza to a serving tray and slice it into equal parts. Garnish with oregano or chili flakes if you'd like, and enjoy the delicious cheese pizza with delectable corn.
